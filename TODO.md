## ðŸŽ¯ Key Technical Implementations

### Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// Nest.js JWT strategy with Redis sessions
@Injectable()
export class JwtStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor(private readonly authService: AuthService) {
    super({
      jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken(),
      secretOrKey: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    });
  }

  async validate(payload: JwtPayload) {
    return this.authService.validateUser(payload);
  }
}
```

### Real-time Features with Redis
```typescript
// Investment portfolio updates
@WebSocketGateway()
export class PortfolioGateway {
  @WebSocketServer()
  server: Server;

  @SubscribeMessage('subscribe-portfolio')
  handleSubscribe(client: Socket, userId: string) {
    this.redisService.subscribe(`portfolio:${userId}`, (update) => {
      client.emit('portfolio-update', update);
    });
  }
}
```

### File Upload with Vercel Blob
```typescript
// Next.js API route for document upload
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
  const filename = searchParams.get('filename');

  const blob = await put(filename, request.body as any, {
    access: 'public',
  });

  return NextResponse.json(blob);
}
```

### Animations with Framer Motion
```typescript
// Smooth page transitions
const pageVariants = {
  initial: { opacity: 0, x: -20 },
  in: { opacity: 1, x: 0 },
  out: { opacity: 0, x: 20 }
};

export const AnimatedPage = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => (
  <motion.div
    initial="initial"
    animate="in"
    exit="out"
    variants={pageVariants}
    transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
  >
    children
  </motion.div>
);
```
